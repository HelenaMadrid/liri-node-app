# Project Title

LIRI Bot

## How does it works?

LIRI Bot is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## How can I use it?

You can use the following commands:

* concert-this [artist/band name here] - Gives you information about concerts
* spotify-this-song [song name] - Gives you information about song name
* movie-this [movie name] - Gives you information about that movie
* do-what-it-says - Reads from random.txt and gets the command and the value and executes the command

**spotify-this-song**

* The user is searching for information about any song that matches the name that the user input, in this case, any song with the name **bellyache** will be printed.

* The user gave no argument after the command, so it will print information about the song of Ace of Base "Sign".
